# COMP282
COMP282 – The C++ Programming Language

You will create a small interactive console-based (i.e. text based) adventure game. The
project consists of 9 tasks. You are expected to use Visual Studio 2022 Community
Edition to build your game. You should complete the tasks in order, as some tasks
assume that previous tasks have been done. Each task builds upon the previous one.
Do as much as you can and then package your project for submission. Your solution
should demonstrate your knowledge of C++. Work alone: You must work alone on the
assignment. Plagiarism checks will be run. If you notice any typos or mistakes in the
assignment that I may have missed, or if you feel something is unclear, please contact me
(andyrox@liverpool.ac.uk) or post a question in the Canvas COMP282 Discussion page
(there is a specific discussion relating to clarification of the assignments).
